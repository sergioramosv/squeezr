# Changelog

All notable changes to Squeezr will be documented here.

## [1.21.3] - 2026-04-10
### Fixed
- **Dashboard: dark theme** — Switched from blue accent to green. Background is now pure black (#09090b) with dark greys. All links, bars, badges, and active states use green (#22c55e/#16a34a).
- **Dashboard: real CLI logos** — Replaced placeholder SVGs with official Bootstrap Icons for Claude (Anthropic star), OpenAI (hexagon), and Google (G icon).
- **Dashboard: removed uptime/Running** — Status shows "Connected" instead of "Running 44s". Uptime removed from header and sidebar.
- **Project detection: excluded URLs** — Fallback regex no longer matches `github.com` or other domains from URLs in the system prompt.
- **`squeezr gain --sesion`** — Added Spanish typo alias.

## [1.21.2] - 2026-04-10
### Fixed
- **Limits: 5h/7d countdown timers** — Shows time remaining until rate limit reset for subscription users. When throttled, displays "throttled — resets in Xh Ym". When allowed, shows "X% free" or "X% used" for high utilization.
- **Limits: CLI logos** — Added Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini SVG icons next to each CLI card header.
- **Dashboard: Squeezr logo in sidebar** — Added the green compression bars SVG logo next to the brand name.
- **Dashboard: removed uptime/Running** — Removed uptime counter from header and sidebar. Status now shows "Connected" instead of "Running 44s".
- **Project detection: fixed `github.com` false positive** — Fallback regex now excludes URLs (`://`), single-char segments, and common system dirs (`mnt`, `c`, `node_modules`, `.claude`, etc.). No longer extracts domain names from URLs in the system prompt.
- **`squeezr gain --sesion`** — Added Spanish typo alias for `--session`.

## [1.21.1] - 2026-04-10
### Fixed
- **Limits page now shows subscription rate limits** — Claude Code subscription (OAuth) uses `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` headers instead of standard per-minute limits. Squeezr now captures the 5-hour rolling window utilization (%), 7-day weekly ceiling utilization (%), and overage status. Dashboard shows these as filled gauges with proper labels ("5-hour window", "7-day window") instead of empty dashes.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-04-10
### Added
- **MCP auto-update notification** — Every MCP tool response now checks npm for newer versions (cached 30 min). When an update is available, appends `🆕 Squeezr vX.Y.Z available. Run: squeezr update` to the tool output so the user sees it naturally in the chat.

## [1.20.1] - 2026-04-10
### Fixed
- **Limits page gauges empty with subscription** — With Claude Code subscription (OAuth), the token/input/output gauges showed "—" even though usage data existed. Now displays session totals (total tokens, input, output, requests) in the gauge areas when rate limit headers are unavailable. Same fix for OpenAI.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-04-10
### Added
- **`squeezr gain --session`** — Live session savings fetched from the running proxy. Shows project name, uptime, breakdown, and by-tool stats.
- **`squeezr gain --details`** — All-time stats with by-tool breakdown.
- **AI compression cost deducted from NET** — When AI compression is active, the estimated token cost of Haiku/GPT-mini calls is now subtracted from NET saved, giving a true net figure.
- **MCP tool `squeezr_set_project`** — Manually set or clear the current project name. Useful when auto-detection shows the wrong name. Set persists until cleared or proxy restarts.
- **`/squeezr/project` REST endpoint** — GET returns current project, POST sets/clears manual override.
- **MCP `squeezr_stats` now includes savings breakdown** — Shows deterministic, AI compression, read dedup, system prompt, and tag overhead in the stats output.

### Fixed
- **Project detection extracted garbage from system prompt** — The fallback regex captured the first path segment after `/Users/` (e.g. "Ramos") instead of the actual project name. Now extracts the LAST meaningful segment, skipping common parent dirs (Users, Documents, home, etc.). For `C:\Users\Ramos\Documents\InvoiceApp` → now correctly returns "InvoiceApp".

### Improved
- **`squeezr gain` aligned box** — Fixed broken alignment where `│` borders didn't close correctly. All rows now use a fixed-width renderer that guarantees exact alignment.
- **`squeezr gain` shows chars + tokens** — Every savings line now shows both chars and approximate tokens side by side.
- **Hidden zero lines** — Lines with 0 savings (e.g. AI compression when not active) are hidden instead of showing "-0 chars".

## [1.19.0] - 2026-04-10
### Added
- **Honest `squeezr gain` with full savings breakdown** — Complete rewrite of the gain report. Now shows each savings source separately: deterministic preprocessing, AI compression, read-dedup, system prompt compression, tag overhead, and estimated AI compression cost. Displays NET savings instead of inflated totals. Warns when AI compression cost exceeds savings.
- **Dashboard: Savings Breakdown section** — New Overview panel showing real-time breakdown of savings by source (deterministic, AI, dedup, system prompt, overhead, AI calls).
- **Dashboard: Relative timestamps in History** — Session cards now show "2h ago", "yesterday", etc. alongside the time range.

### Fixed
- **Limits page showed all dashes with Claude Code subscription** — Claude Code with Max/Pro subscription uses OAuth (not API key), and Anthropic does not send `anthropic-ratelimit-*` headers for subscription users. The Limits page required these headers to show ANY data. Now shows usage counters (session/today input/output tokens) regardless of rate limit headers, with a "subscription" badge instead of "live". Same fix applied to OpenAI and Gemini.

### Improved
- **Dashboard: History filters empty sessions** — Sessions with 0 requests are no longer shown.
- **Dashboard: Budget bar updates on Save** — Clicking Save now re-renders the budget bar with current usage data instead of resetting to 0.
- **Dashboard: Mode change reverts on failure** — If the POST to `/squeezr/config` fails, the UI reverts to the previous active mode button instead of staying in a broken state.

### Fixed
- **Triangular accumulation bug in `stats.ts`** — `persist()` was writing cumulative session totals on each request instead of deltas, causing exponential inflation of saved chars. Now writes only the delta from each request.
- **Deterministic savings not counted** — `preprocessForTool()` savings (strip ANSI, collapse whitespace, git/test patterns) were logged but never included in `Savings`. Now tracked and reported.
- **Read-dedup savings not counted** — Duplicate file reads were collapsed but chars saved were not included in metrics. Now tracked and reported.
- **Tag overhead not subtracted from savings** — `buildAndCache()` calculated `savedChars = original - result` without accounting for the `[squeezr:XXXX -NN%]` tag added to each compressed block (~35 chars). Now uses `original - fullString` for accurate NET savings.
- **System prompt compression not tracked** — `compressSystemPrompt()` now returns original/compressed lengths; savings are tracked separately in stats.
- **Project detection was always 'unknown'** — `extractProjectName()` ran AFTER system prompt compression, which destroyed the `<cwd>` tags. Moved extraction before compression for both Anthropic and OpenAI handlers. Projects page now correctly detects and tracks per-project stats.
- **Gemini streaming token tracking broken** — SSE parser incorrectly used Anthropic event format (`message_start`/`message_delta`) for Gemini streams. Replaced with a JSON chunk parser that extracts `usageMetadata` from Gemini's actual streaming format.
- **OpenAI billing never populated in streaming mode** — `maybeRefreshOpenAIBilling()` was only called in the non-streaming path. Since Codex uses streaming exclusively, the Limits page never showed OpenAI credits/limits. Now called in both paths.
- **Streaming request count inflated 2x for Anthropic** — `addAnthropicUsage` incremented `requestsSession` on both `message_start` (input) and `message_delta` (output) SSE events. Now only counts on input tokens (one per request).
- **OpenAI billing `lastFetched` updated on failure** — If both billing API calls failed, the 5-minute cooldown still applied, preventing retries. Now only updates `lastFetched` when at least one request succeeds.
- **Budget tracker label mismatch** — Dashboard showed "tokens/month" but used daily counters that reset at midnight. Labels corrected to "tokens/day".
- **Budget save button triggered mode change** — The `#budget-save` button shared the `.mode-btn` class, causing mode buttons to deactivate visually when saving budget. Separated into its own class.
- **Dead code removed** — Unused `CHARS_PER_TOKEN` constant in `limits.ts`.

## [1.17.13] - 2026-04-10
### Fixed
- **SSL cert load failure on second terminal** — `ensureCA()` now always regenerates `bundle.crt` on startup instead of only on first run. Fixes the `warn: ignoring extra certs … load failed: error:10000002:SSL routines:OPENSSL_internal:system library` warning that appeared when opening a new Claude terminal.
- **System CA bundle removed from `bundle.crt`** — The bundle previously concatenated the system CA store (`/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`) which could contain certs that BoringSSL/Node.js rejects (notably in WSL). `bundle.crt` now contains only the Squeezr self-signed CA cert; Node.js trusts its own root CAs independently.

## [1.17.12] - 2026-04-06
### Added
- **Dashboard URL in banner** — `squeezr start`, `squeezr status`, and `squeezr update` now print `Dashboard: http://localhost:PORT/squeezr/dashboard` alongside the proxy URLs.
- **Dashboard port in `squeezr ports`** — Shows dashboard URL (shares the proxy port) in the current-ports summary.
### Fixed
- **`squeezr stop` now kills MCP server** — New `killMcpProcesses()` helper kills the `squeezr-mcp` Node process (stdio MCP server) when stopping. Uses PowerShell `Get-CimInstance` (replaces deprecated `wmic`) on Windows, `pkill` on Unix.
- **`squeezr update` uses same helper** — Replaced the broken `wmic` calls with `killMcpProcesses()`, which works on Windows 11 (wmic removed). Retry loop also uses it.
- **`squeezr uninstall` removes MCP registrations** — Calls `mcpUninstall()` before removing the npm package, cleaning `.claude.json`, Cursor, Windsurf, and Cline MCP configs automatically.

## [1.17.11] - 2026-04-06
### Fixed
- **SyntaxError on startup** — `mcpInstall()` was missing a closing `}` for the catch block (introduced in v1.17.6), causing `Unexpected end of input` on Node.js v24. All commands were broken on fresh installs. Also fixed `installed` counter not being incremented inside the try block.

## [1.17.10] - 2026-04-06
### Fixed
- **`squeezr update` EBUSY on Windows** — The MCP server process (`squeezr-mcp`) launched by Claude Code kept `dist/mcp.js` and other dist files locked, preventing npm from renaming the module directory. Fix: `update` now kills squeezr-mcp via `wmic` before installing, waits 2 s (up from 1 s), and retries npm install up to 4 times (3 s apart) on `EBUSY`/`EPERM` errors, with a broader wmic sweep on each retry. Clear error message if all retries fail.

## [1.17.9] - 2026-04-06
### Added
- **LIMITS dashboard page** — 5th sidebar page showing real-time rate limit gauges and token consumption per CLI.
- **Anthropic rate limits (live)** — `anthropic-ratelimit-*` headers extracted from every Anthropic response. Shows tokens/min remaining, requests/min remaining, input/output token sub-limits, and countdown to reset. Badge turns green on first data.
- **OpenAI rate limits (live)** — `x-ratelimit-*` headers extracted from every OpenAI response. Shows tokens/min and requests/min remaining with reset countdowns.
- **OpenAI billing** — `GET /v1/dashboard/billing/subscription` + `credit_grants` polled every 5 min using the API key seen in requests. Shows credit balance and hard limit in USD.
- **Gemini quota tracking** — Google does not expose quota headers on success; Squeezr records them when a 429 error occurs. Shows last known limit and 429 error count.
- **Token usage counters** — Input + output tokens accumulated from response bodies and SSE stream events (`message_start`, `message_delta` for Anthropic; final usage chunk for OpenAI). Shown per-CLI: session total and today total with automatic midnight rollover.
- **Personal monthly budget bar** — User enters a monthly token budget in the LIMITS page; Squeezr renders a progress bar with color-coded fill (green → yellow → red). Persisted in localStorage.
- **Reset countdown timer** — 1-second interval updates "resets in Xs" counters on rate limit gauges while the LIMITS page is visible.
- **`GET /squeezr/limits`** — New REST endpoint returning the full limits snapshot (rate limits + usage + billing).

## [1.17.8] - 2026-04-06
### Added
- **Dashboard sidebar navigation** — 4-page SPA: Overview, Projects, History, Settings. Replaces the single-page layout.
- **SVG icons throughout** — sidebar nav icons and compression mode buttons (Soft/Normal/Aggressive/Critical) now use clean SVG icons instead of emojis.
- **Per-project stats** — Squeezr detects which project is active by extracting the working directory from Claude Code's system prompt (`<cwd>` tag). Projects page shows aggregate stats across all sessions per project.
- **Session history** — History page shows all past proxy sessions grouped by project and day, with start/end time, duration, request count, and tokens saved. Persists to `~/.squeezr/history.json`.
- **Project-aware Overview** — project name badge shown in the dashboard header when a project is detected.
- **New API endpoints** — `GET /squeezr/history`, `GET /squeezr/projects`, `POST /squeezr/control/stop`.
- **MCP: squeezr_stop** — stop the proxy gracefully from any MCP-compatible AI CLI.
- **MCP: squeezr_check_updates** — check npm registry for newer Squeezr version.
- **MCP: squeezr_update** — update to latest version via `npm install -g squeezr-ai@latest`.

## [1.17.7] - 2026-04-06
### Fixed
- Removed stale `dist/cursorMitm.js` from npm package (leaked again after clean build). Added `prepack` script to auto-delete it permanently on every publish.

## [1.17.6] - 2026-04-06
### Added
- **Squeezr MCP server** — Universal MCP server (`squeezr-mcp`) compatible with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and any MCP-capable AI CLI. Exposes 5 tools:
  - `squeezr_status` — Check if proxy is running; returns version, port, uptime, compression mode.
  - `squeezr_stats` — Real-time token savings, compression %, cost saved estimate, per-tool breakdown.
  - `squeezr_set_mode` — Hot-reload compression mode (soft/normal/aggressive/critical) without restarting.
  - `squeezr_config` — Current thresholds, keepRecent, cache sizes, available modes.
  - `squeezr_habits` — Detects wasteful patterns this session (duplicate reads, excessive Bash calls, cache efficiency).
- **Auto-install on setup** — `squeezr setup` automatically registers the MCP server in Claude Code (`~/.claude.json`), Cursor (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`), Windsurf, and Cline. Manual control via `squeezr mcp install` / `squeezr mcp uninstall`.

## [1.17.4] - 2026-04-06
### Fixed
- Repackage: removed in-progress `cursorMitm.js` that was accidentally included in 1.17.3 dist. No functional changes vs 1.17.3.
## [1.17.5] - 2026-04-06
### Added
- **Real-time web dashboard** — `GET /squeezr/dashboard` opens a live dark-theme dashboard. Updates every 2s via SSE. Shows tokens saved, compression %, requests, estimated cost saved, per-tool breakdown, sparkline chart, context pressure bars, and cache sizes.
- **Compression mode selector** — Switch 🐢 Soft / ⚖️ Normal / 🔥 Aggressive / 🚨 Critical from the dashboard with instant effect via `POST /squeezr/config { mode }`.
- **Hot-reload compression mode** — Mode changes take effect immediately without restarting the proxy. Overrides TOML thresholds and keepRecent in memory.
- **Port conflict auto-recovery** — On `EADDRINUSE`, Squeezr scans upward and binds to the first free port, printing a clear warning instead of crashing.
- **Dashboard URL on startup** — `http://localhost:PORT/squeezr/dashboard` printed when proxy starts.

## [1.17.3] - 2026-04-06
### Fixed
- **Critical: AI compression burst on first activation** — On first use with existing long conversations, ALL historical tool results were sent as simultaneous Haiku API calls via `Promise.allSettled`, consuming the entire Anthropic token quota in minutes. Now only tool results from the **current user message** (genuinely new blocks) are AI-compressed. All historical uncached blocks receive deterministic-only compression (free, no API calls).
- **Session cache and expand store persist to disk** — Both stores survive terminal restarts (`~/.squeezr/session_cache.json` and `~/.squeezr/expand_store.json`). On startup, previously compressed blocks are loaded from disk — reopening any terminal with a long conversation causes zero Haiku API calls. Caches flush every 60s and on SIGINT/SIGTERM.
- **Read tool excluded from AI compression by default** — Code files are never AI-summarized (destroys quality). Only free deterministic preprocessing is applied. Configurable via `ai_skip_tools` in `squeezr.toml`.
- **System prompt array format now compressed** — Claude Code sends `system` as an array (`[{type:'text', text:'...'}]`); the previous `typeof system === 'string'` guard was always `false`, silently skipping system prompt compression entirely.
- **`estimatePressure` includes system prompt size** — Context pressure was computed from message chars only, ignoring the large system prompt. Adaptive thresholds now account for the full context correctly.

## [1.17.2] - 2026-04-03
### Added
- **Cursor IDE subscription MITM proxy** — `squeezr cursor` starts an HTTP/2 MITM proxy on port 8082 that transparently intercepts Cursor's ConnectRPC traffic to `api2.cursor.sh`. Compresses conversation context using Cursor's own models (cursor-small) or deterministic preprocessing. Works with Cursor's subscription plan — no separate API key (BYOK) needed. Chat, Agent, and Composer modes are compressed; tab completions (cursor-small) are not interceptable. System proxy is configured/cleaned up automatically on start/stop.
- **Cursor BYOK support via tunnel** — `squeezr tunnel` starts a Cloudflare Quick Tunnel exposing the proxy as a public HTTPS URL. Use this URL in Cursor → Settings → Models → Override OpenAI Base URL to route Cursor chat/agent through Squeezr. No account or install required (uses `cloudflared` or `npx cloudflared@latest` as fallback).
- **Continue extension support** — VS Code and JetBrains Continue extension works directly with `apiBase: http://localhost:8080/v1`. No tunnel needed.
- **CORS middleware** — Cursor's Electron renderer sends OPTIONS preflight before every POST. The proxy now responds with `204 + Access-Control-Allow-*` headers so Cursor can connect without CORS errors. Has no effect on CLI tools.

## [1.17.1] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **`HTTPS_PROXY` no longer set globally on macOS/Linux/WSL** — the same root cause as the Windows 502 bug in v1.17.0 was present in the Unix shell profile setup and the bash/zsh shell wrapper. `HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:8081` was being exported into `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, and `~/.profile`, routing all HTTPS traffic (including Claude Code) through the MITM proxy and causing 502 errors on every request. Fixed in `setupUnix()`, `setupWSL()`, `installBashWrapper()`, and `configurePorts()`.
- **`SSL_CERT_FILE` no longer set globally** — this variable was pointing to a bundle containing only the Squeezr MITM CA cert (not the full system CA bundle), which would break TLS verification for all tools using OpenSSL. Replaced with `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` which is additive and safe.
- **macOS Keychain trust for MITM CA** — `squeezr setup` on macOS now adds the MITM CA certificate to the login Keychain so Codex (Rust binary) trusts the proxy's TLS certificate.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-04-03
### Added
- **Shell wrappers auto-refresh env vars** — `squeezr setup` and `squeezr update` install a shell wrapper (PowerShell on Windows, bash/zsh on Linux/macOS/WSL) that automatically applies env vars to the current session after `start`, `setup`, or `update`. No more closing and reopening terminals. Shows a one-time banner on first install. `squeezr uninstall` cleans it up.
- **`squeezr update` resolves the new binary correctly** — finds the freshly installed package via `npm root -g` and spawns the daemon directly. No stale version issues on WSL or Windows.

### Fixed
- **Node.js v24 compatibility** — strip `Expect` header from forwarded requests. Node 24's undici rejects this header, causing 500 errors on all proxied requests.
- **`HTTPS_PROXY` no longer set globally on Windows** — routing all HTTPS traffic through the MITM proxy broke Claude Code (502), npm (ECONNREFUSED), and other tools. `HTTPS_PROXY` is now only needed for Codex and should be set per-session.
- **`squeezr stop` clears `HTTPS_PROXY` from Windows registry** — cleans up the legacy entry left by older versions.
- **`squeezr update` no longer shows stale "Update available" banner** — update cache is written with the new version after install.

## [1.16.6] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **`squeezr uninstall` now runs `npm uninstall -g`** automatically — full removal in one command, no manual step needed.
- **`update` and `uninstall` clear `HTTPS_PROXY` before npm commands** — prevents ECONNREFUSED when npm tries to go through the dead proxy.
- **Update banner no longer shows stale/inverted versions** — cache is cleared after `squeezr update`.

## [1.16.5] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **Env vars now written to `~/.profile`** — fixes Claude Code 502 errors caused by env vars in `.bashrc` being skipped by the `case $-` interactive-shell guard. Login shells (and WSL default terminals) load `.profile` before `.bashrc`'s guard, so `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is always available.
- **`squeezr uninstall` cleans `.profile`** too.

## [1.16.4] - 2026-04-03
### Added
- **`squeezr update`** — one command to kill all old processes (brute force on both ports), install latest from npm, and start the new version. Fixes 502 errors caused by stale processes surviving updates.
- Update notification banner now suggests `squeezr update` instead of `npm install -g`.

## [1.16.3] - 2026-04-03
### Added
- **Update notifications** — Squeezr checks npm for new versions every 4 hours (non-blocking, cached in `~/.squeezr/update-check.json`). Shows a banner after any command if a newer version is available.

## [1.16.2] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **`squeezr ports` now applies changes immediately** — auto-stops and restarts the proxy after changing ports, updates shell profiles (Unix) and Windows registry (WSL) automatically. No more manual export/restart needed.
- **Port config reads from `squeezr.toml`** — all commands now read the HTTP port from toml as fallback when env var isn't set. Prevents port mismatch after `squeezr ports` in a fresh terminal.

## [1.16.1] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **`squeezr stop` shows both ports** — output now matches `start` and `status` format, showing both HTTP and MITM proxy ports. Uses configured ports from `squeezr.toml` / env vars.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-04-03
### Added
- **`squeezr uninstall`** — completely removes Squeezr: stops proxy, removes env vars (Windows registry / shell profiles), removes CA from certificate store, removes auto-start (NSSM/Task Scheduler/launchd/systemd), deletes `~/.squeezr` and config.
### Fixed
- **Auto-restart on version mismatch** — `squeezr start` now checks if the running process version matches the installed version. If mismatched (e.g. after `npm update`), it auto-kills the old process and starts the new one. This was the root cause of 502 errors after updates.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-04-03
### Added
- **`squeezr ports` command** — interactive prompt to change HTTP proxy and MITM proxy ports. Updates `squeezr.toml` and env vars.
- **`mitmPort` config field** — MITM proxy port is now independently configurable via `mitm_port` in `squeezr.toml` or `SQUEEZR_MITM_PORT` env var. Defaults to `port + 1`.

## [1.14.14] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **`start` and `already running` messages show both proxies** — output now lists HTTP proxy (:8080) and MITM proxy (:8081) with their purpose, matching `status` output.

## [1.14.13] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **`squeezr stop` kills zombies** — now kills all processes on both port 8080 (HTTP proxy) and 8081 (MITM proxy) with `kill -9`. No more stale processes surviving a version update.
- **`squeezr status` shows both proxies** — output now lists both the HTTP proxy (Claude/Aider/Gemini) and MITM proxy (Codex) with their ports.

## [1.14.12] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **Node 18 compatibility** — replaced `import.meta.dirname` (Node 22+) with `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` in config loader. Fixes crash on WSL/Linux with Node 18.

## [1.14.11] - 2026-04-03
### Changed
- Reverted Node 18 compat — set engines to `>=22`. (Reverted in 1.14.12)

## [1.14.10] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **Version desync** — `version.ts` was hardcoded and never updated by `npm version`. Now reads version from `package.json` at runtime.

## [1.14.9] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- Same as 1.14.10 — initial fix for version desync.

## [1.14.8] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **npm/git ECONNREFUSED** — the MITM proxy was TLS-terminating ALL CONNECT requests (npm, git, curl, etc.), causing failures when Squeezr was the system `HTTPS_PROXY`. Now only `chatgpt.com` gets TLS-terminated; all other domains get a transparent TCP tunnel. Removes `NO_PROXY` from setup since it's no longer needed.

## [1.14.7] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **Codex CA trust on Windows** — Codex is a Rust binary that uses the Windows Certificate Store, not `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. Setup now imports the MITM CA via `certutil -addstore -user Root` (no admin required) with machine-level fallback.
- **Docs rewrite** — README.md and CODEX.md fully rewritten with accurate architecture, per-platform CA trust, and configuration reference.

## [1.14.6] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **Claude 502** — `forwardHeaders()` was passing the `Upgrade` header to undici's `fetch`, which throws `InvalidArgumentError: invalid upgrade header`. Added `upgrade` to `SKIP_REQ_HEADERS`. Root cause confirmed from production logs.

## [1.14.5] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **Codex auth.openai.com blocked** — `HTTPS_PROXY` was intercepting ALL HTTPS traffic including OpenAI auth endpoints. Added `NO_PROXY` excluding `auth.openai.com`, `api.openai.com`, `api.anthropic.com` and others so only `chatgpt.com` WebSocket traffic goes through the MITM.
- **Codex JWT routed to Ollama** — `isLocalKey()` returned `true` for JWT tokens (`eyJ...`) because they don't start with `sk-`. Added `!k.startsWith('eyj')` check so Codex OAuth tokens route to OpenAI, not local.
- **OpenAI compression loop** — `compressWithGptMini()` inherited `openai_base_url=http://localhost:8080` from the environment, causing compression calls to loop back through Squeezr. Now hardcodes `baseURL: 'https://api.openai.com/v1'`.

## [1.14.4] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **Codex routing** — `/responses` was still hitting Anthropic when no auth header present because `detectUpstream` defaults to Anthropic. Now `/v1/responses` explicitly forces upstream to OpenAI regardless of headers. Verified: request reaches `api.openai.com/v1/responses` correctly.

## [1.14.3] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **Claude 502** — `compressWithHaiku()` was creating `new Anthropic()` without an explicit `baseURL`, so the SDK inherited `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080` from the environment and sent compression requests back to Squeezr itself, causing infinite recursion. Now always uses `https://api.anthropic.com` directly.
- **Codex 404** — catch-all was forwarding `/responses` to `api.openai.com/responses` (no `/v1/`). Added `/responses` to `NEEDS_V1` so it correctly maps to `/v1/responses`.
- **Codex auth** — Codex CLI does not include its OAuth Bearer token when `openai_base_url` points to a custom proxy. Squeezr now reads it from `~/.codex/auth.json` and injects it automatically when the outbound request has no `authorization` header.

## [1.14.2] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **`squeezr setup` on Windows** — set `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` pointing to the MITM CA. Node.js (Codex CLI) does not use the Windows Certificate Store, so `certutil` alone was insufficient — the Codex process would reject the MITM certificate. `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` adds the CA to Node.js's trusted roots without replacing the default bundle.

## [1.14.1] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **`squeezr setup` on Windows** — now sets `HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:8081` via `setx` so Codex MITM interception is configured automatically.
- **MITM CA trust on Windows** — after starting the proxy, setup waits for the CA cert to be generated and runs `certutil -addstore Root` to trust it in the Windows Certificate Store. Falls back with a manual command if admin is required.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **`squeezr setup` on Windows** — auto-start now uses NSSM when available, registering Squeezr as a proper Windows service with automatic restart on crash. Falls back to Task Scheduler if NSSM is not installed or admin privileges are missing. Eliminates `ConnectionRefused` errors caused by the proxy crashing mid-session without recovery.
- **NSSM service config** — stdout/stderr logs to `~/.squeezr/service-stdout.log` / `service-stderr.log` with 24h rotation and 3s restart delay.

### Added
- `NSSM_WINDOWS_SERVICE.md` — full guide covering installation, service creation, log inspection, troubleshooting, and uninstall.
- README — NSSM documented as recommended Windows auto-start method with quick-install commands.

## [1.13.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **`squeezr stop` on WSL2** — `lsof -ti :PORT` returns multiple PIDs (listening process + connected clients); now uses `-sTCP:LISTEN` flag to get only the listening process, with fallback to `fuser`. Stops reliably on first try.
- **`squeezr setup` on Unix** — detects existing shell profiles missing `HTTPS_PROXY`/`SSL_CERT_FILE` (MITM proxy vars from older installs) and rewrites the block to include them.
- **`squeezr setup` on WSL2** — same fix as Unix: old profiles without MITM vars now get updated automatically.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Codex MITM compression** — Squeezr can now compress OpenAI Codex CLI context in real-time. A TLS-terminating MITM proxy on port 8081 intercepts Codex's WebSocket traffic to `chatgpt.com`, finds `function_call_output` tool results exceeding the threshold, and compresses them via a separate WebSocket call to `gpt-5.4-mini` using the same ChatGPT OAuth token — no API keys needed, no extra costs beyond your existing Codex subscription.
- **WebSocket frame parser/builder** — full implementation of RFC 6455 frame encoding/decoding with masking support, used for both intercepting Codex frames and making compression requests.
- **Automatic `permessage-deflate` stripping** — the MITM strips `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` from upgrade requests so frames arrive as plain text, avoiding deflate context desync when modifying payloads.
- **`chatgpt-account-id` capture** — intercepted from HTTP requests and forwarded to compression calls for proper account scoping.

### Changed
- **MITM proxy rewritten** — replaced the broken HTTP POST compression approach (Cloudflare 403) with direct WebSocket-to-WebSocket compression. The proxy now opens a dedicated WS connection to `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` for each compression call.
- Removed unused dependencies: `ws`, `fzstd`, `@types/ws`.
- Removed unused `oauthRefresh.ts`.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Codex MITM proxy (experimental)** — HTTPS proxy on port 8081 with auto-generated CA for TLS termination. Intercepts `CONNECT` tunnels, generates per-host certificates, and supports WebSocket upgrade detection. `squeezr setup` now configures `HTTPS_PROXY` and `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variables for Codex integration.
- **`node-forge` dependency** — for CA/certificate generation.

## [1.11.3] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **Codex WebSocket proxy** — Codex v0.118 uses WebSocket (`ws://`) for the Responses API. Squeezr now upgrades HTTP connections on `/responses` and `/v1/responses` to a bidirectional WebSocket proxy that forwards to `wss://api.openai.com`. Includes automatic ChatGPT OAuth token refresh on `401` mid-stream.
- **WebSocket routing for OAuth tokens** — ChatGPT OAuth bearer tokens (JWTs starting with `eyJ`) were incorrectly detected as local Ollama keys, routing WebSocket traffic to `ws://localhost:11434` instead of `wss://api.openai.com`. Fixed by excluding JWT-format tokens from the local-key check.
- **OAuth token proxy** — added `/oauth/token` pass-through so Codex can use `CODEX_REFRESH_TOKEN_URL_OVERRIDE=http://localhost:PORT/oauth/token` when needed.
- **`/models` path rewrite** — catch-all now rewrites bare `/models` (and other OpenAI root paths) to `/v1/models` so Codex model enumeration works correctly.

## [1.11.2] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **Codex / OpenAI Responses API support** — Codex CLI uses the Responses API (`POST /responses`) instead of Chat Completions. Squeezr now has dedicated routes for both `/responses` and `/v1/responses` with full streaming (SSE pipe-through), compression of `function_call_output` tool results, and correct header forwarding. Previously these requests fell through to the catch-all, which blocked indefinitely on streaming responses and caused 401 errors.
- **Catch-all streaming** — the catch-all handler now detects `text/event-stream` responses and pipes them through correctly instead of buffering the full response with `arrayBuffer()`.

## [1.11.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Daemon resilience** — `squeezr start` now survives Ctrl+C and terminal close. The daemon ignores `SIGINT` and `SIGHUP`; only `squeezr stop` (which sends `SIGTERM`) can stop it. Dev mode (`npm run dev`) still responds to Ctrl+C as before.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **WSL2 support** — `squeezr setup` now detects WSL2 automatically. Configures both the WSL shell profile (`.bashrc`/`.zshrc`) and Windows environment (`setx`). Auto-start cascades: systemd → Windows Task Scheduler → shell auto-heal.
- **Auto-heal guard** — on all Unix platforms (macOS, Linux, WSL2), `squeezr setup` adds a shell profile snippet that checks if the proxy is alive on every terminal open and starts it in the background if not. Zero manual intervention after setup, ever.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **`squeezr setup`** — one-command setup on any OS. Sets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `openai_base_url`, `GEMINI_API_BASE_URL` permanently and registers Squeezr as a login service (Task Scheduler on Windows, launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux). After running `squeezr setup` once and restarting the terminal, everything works automatically.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **OAuth / subscription support** — Claude Code via claude.ai subscription (no API key) now works fully. Squeezr extracts the `Authorization: Bearer` token and reuses it for Haiku compression calls, so no extra credentials are needed regardless of how you authenticate.
- **`skip_tools` / `only_tools` config** — explicit control over which tools Squeezr compresses. `skip_tools = ["Read"]` blacklists specific tools; `only_tools = ["Bash"]` whitelists (takes priority over skip_tools).
- **`# squeezr:skip` inline marker** — add anywhere in a Bash command to prevent that specific result from being compressed (e.g. `git diff HEAD~3  # squeezr:skip`). Supported in Anthropic and OpenAI formats.
- **10 new tests** — `shouldSkipTool` logic in config (7 cases), skip/only/inline-skip in compressor (3 cases) (190 total)

### Changed
- `Config.shouldSkipTool(name)` method: checks `onlyTools` whitelist first, then `skipTools` blacklist
- `squeezr.toml`: added commented-out examples for `skip_tools`, `only_tools`, and inline `# squeezr:skip`
- Published as `squeezr-ai` on npm (name `squeezr` was taken by an unrelated image tool)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Health endpoint returned `v1.0.0`** — `GET /squeezr/health` now returns the real version. Introduced `src/version.ts` as single source of truth; `index.ts` and `server.ts` both import from it. No more manual version drift across files.
- **`squeezr discover` showed `readDedup: 0`** — cross-turn Read dedup runs in `compressor.ts`, not `deterministic.ts`. Added exported `hitPattern()` to `deterministic.ts` and call it from the dedup step.

### Added
- **Cross-turn Read dedup for OpenAI/Gemini** — parity with Anthropic format. `compressOpenAIMessages` and `compressGeminiContents` now detect and collapse duplicate file reads.
- **Adaptive deterministic patterns at high context pressure** — patterns now receive the request's `pressure` value and tighten thresholds automatically:
  - `git diff` at >90%: 0 context lines per hunk (was always 1)
  - `git log` at >75%: cap 20 commits; at >90%: cap 10 (was always 30)
  - `grep` at >75%: 6 matches/file; at >90%: 4 (was always 8)
  - generic truncation at >90%: keep last 30 lines from 50-line threshold (was 80/50)
- `pressure` param threaded through `preprocessForTool` → `applyBashPatterns` (backward-compatible default = 0)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Per-project `.squeezr.toml`** — Squeezr now looks for `.squeezr.toml` in the working directory and deep-merges it over the global config. Enables per-repo overrides (thresholds, compression model, etc.)
- **Cross-turn Read deduplication** — when the model reads the same file multiple times in a session, earlier occurrences are replaced with `[same file content as a later read — squeezr_expand(id) to retrieve]`. Keeps the most recent copy at full fidelity; collapses all earlier identical reads.
- **`squeezr discover`** — pattern coverage CLI that queries the running proxy and prints which deterministic patterns fired, how many outputs hit the generic fallback, and Read/Grep/Glob breakdown. Run after a session to spot coverage gaps.
- **Pattern hit tracking** — `detPatternHits` counter in `deterministic.ts` tracks every pattern match; exposed via `/squeezr/stats` as `pattern_hits`
- **README badges** — npm version, license, Node.js version, test count
- `src/discover.ts` new CLI command

### Changed
- `bin/squeezr.js`: added `discover` subcommand, bumped version string to 1.8.0

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Stack trace deduplication** — repeated Node.js/Python stack frames collapsed to `[same N-frame stack trace repeated]`; runs in base pipeline before per-tool patterns
- **Git diff function summary** — large diffs (>100 output lines) get a `Changed: fn1, fn2, ...` prefix extracted from `@@` headers
- **Semantic Read for large code files** — `.ts/.js/.py/.go/.rs` files >500 lines show imports + top-level signatures only, bodies omitted; smaller files keep head+tail
- 6 new tests (180 total)

### Changed
- `deduplicateStackTraces` runs before `deduplicateLines` in base pipeline (block-level dedup must precede line-level dedup)

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Playwright test compaction** — strips passing `✓` lines, keeps `✘`/FAILED blocks with context
- **Python/pytest compaction** — keeps `FAILED`/`ERROR` lines + tracebacks, strips passing dots
- **Go test compaction** — keeps `--- FAIL` blocks + `FAIL` summary, strips `--- PASS`
- **Terraform compaction** — keeps resource change blocks + Plan summary, strips attribute noise
- **`git branch` compaction** — caps at 20 branches with omission note
- **wget compaction** — strips progress/connection noise, keeps final URL + save path
- **Generic error extractor** — auto-extracts error lines ± context from any unrecognised output > 30 lines with > 50% noise (replaces manual `rtk err <cmd>` prefix)
- 15 new tests (174 total)

### Fixed
- `looksLikeGitBranch` false positive on Playwright output (now requires pure `[* ] identifier` branch name pattern, no colons/parens/brackets)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **`git status` compaction** — detects and compacts to `* branch [tracking] + Staged/Modified/Untracked` format (RTK parity)
- **`git log --oneline` detection** — caps at 30 commits with `... [N more commits]` (full verbose format was already supported)
- **`pnpm list` / `npm list` compaction** — keeps direct deps, strips nested tree with omission count
- **`pnpm outdated` compaction** — caps at 30 packages
- **Prisma CLI compaction** — strips ASCII box-drawing tip blocks, keeps meaningful output
- **`gh pr checks` compaction** — caps large check tables at 25 rows
- **Generic long-output truncation** — any unrecognised bash output > 80 lines gets last 50 lines + omission note (replaces the overly-broad docker logs detector)
- 20 new tests covering all new patterns (159 total)

### Fixed
- `looksLikePkgList` false-positive on Prisma box-drawing output (now requires `├──` not just `└──`)
- `looksLikeKubectl` false-positive on `gh pr checks` header (now requires specific kubectl column patterns)
- `compactGitStatus` on clean working tree now shows "nothing to commit" message

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Full unit test suite** — 139 tests across 6 test files covering all modules: `deterministic.ts`, `cache.ts`, `sessionCache.ts`, `expand.ts`, `config.ts`, `compressor.ts`

### Fixed
- `extractInstallSummary` regex `/\d+ packages? in/` → `/\d+ packages? in \d/` to prevent false matches on `packages installed`

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Full RTK pattern parity** — Squeezr now covers all major RTK tool patterns at the proxy level. No manual `rtk` prefix needed for any of these:
  - **git**: `diff` (context reduction to 1 line/hunk), `log` (one line per commit)
  - **cargo**: `test` (failures only), `build/check/clippy` (errors/warnings only, no "Compiling X" spam)
  - **JS/TS**: `vitest/jest` (failures only + summary), `tsc` (errors grouped by file), `eslint/biome` (grouped, no rule URLs), `prettier --check` (files needing format only), `next build` (route table + errors only)
  - **package managers**: `pnpm/npm install` (summary line only)
  - **Docker**: `ps` (compact), `images` (no dangling, short IDs), `logs` (last 50 lines)
  - **kubectl**: `get` (compact column alignment)
  - **gh CLI**: `pr view` (metadata only), `run list` (capped), `issue list` (capped)
  - **curl**: strip verbose `-v` headers, keep response body
- **Grep tool compaction** — matches grouped by file, capped at 8 per file, max 30 files
- **Read tool compaction** — files >200 lines show head + tail with omission note; lockfiles replaced with summary count

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **RTK-style turn-1 compression** — `preprocessForTool()` applies tool-specific deterministic patterns to ALL tool results including recent ones. No need to prefix commands with `rtk`. Covers: `git diff` (context line reduction), `cargo test/build/clippy` (errors/failures only), `vitest/jest` (failures only), `tsc` (errors grouped by file), `eslint/biome` (grouped, no rule URLs), `pnpm/npm install` (summary only), `Glob` (compact file listings).
- **Deterministic compression is now always on, even for recent blocks** — previously only AI compression was skipped for recent blocks. Now all blocks get at minimum the RTK-style pass.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Differential compression** — session-level cache tracks compressed blocks across requests. Blocks identical to a previous request skip the entire pipeline (preprocessing + AI call). In a 100-request session with 40 tool results: ~4,000 Haiku calls → ~200.
- **KV cache warming** — `storeOriginal` now uses a deterministic MD5-based ID instead of random bytes. Identical content always produces the same `[squeezr:id -ratio%]` string, preserving Anthropic's prefix cache across requests (90% cost reduction on unchanged history).
- `sessionCache.ts` — in-memory Map persisting for the lifetime of the proxy session
- `session_cache_hits` counter in stats summary and `/squeezr/stats` endpoint
- `session_cache_size` exposed in `/squeezr/stats`

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-31

### Changed
- **Full TypeScript rewrite** — entire codebase migrated from Python to TypeScript/Node.js
- **Hono** replaces FastAPI as the HTTP framework — faster startup, no Python runtime needed
- No more `pip install` — pure npm package, install with `npm install -g squeezr`
- Requires Node.js 18+ (was Python 3.9+)

### Added
- **Deterministic preprocessing pipeline** (6 stages before AI compression): strip ANSI codes, strip progress bars, strip timestamps, deduplicate repeated lines, minify inline JSON, collapse whitespace
- **`expand()` feature** — model can call `squeezr_expand(id)` to retrieve original content when needed; Squeezr intercepts the tool call and makes a continuation request transparently
- **Gemini CLI support** (`POST /v1beta/models/*`) — compresses `functionResponse` blocks using Gemini Flash 8B
- **Per-format compression**: Anthropic `tool_result`, OpenAI `role:tool`, Gemini `functionResponse`
- **`GET /squeezr/expand/:id`** endpoint to retrieve stored originals via HTTP
- LRU compression cache with configurable max entries
- System prompt compression with separate cache (`~/.squeezr/sysprompt_cache.json`)
- `src/gain.ts` — TypeScript gain stats CLI replacing `gain.py`

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Ollama / local LLM support** — requests with dummy keys (`ollama`, `lm-studio`, etc.) are detected as local and routed to Ollama
- **Configurable compression model** — set any model you have installed via `squeezr.toml [local] compression_model` or `SQUEEZR_LOCAL_MODEL` env var
- **`[local]` config section** in `squeezr.toml` with `upstream_url`, `compression_model`, and `dummy_keys`
- `config.is_local_key()` detects local requests from auth key
- `compress_local_messages()` uses Ollama's OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint for compression
- `SQUEEZR_LOCAL_UPSTREAM` and `SQUEEZR_LOCAL_MODEL` env var overrides

### Changed
- `/v1/chat/completions` now checks for local key before routing to OpenAI
- Version bumped to 0.6.0

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Gemini CLI support** — `/v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent` endpoint intercepts and compresses Gemini requests
- **Gemini Flash 8B compression** — cheapest Google model compresses `functionResponse` parts, reuses `x-goog-api-key` from request
- **Gemini system instruction compression** — `systemInstruction` field compressed via Flash 8B and cached
- **Gemini streaming** — `streamGenerateContent` SSE forwarded transparently
- `system_prompt.py` now supports `use_google=True` for Gemini system prompts
- `extract_google_key()` reads `x-goog-api-key` header or `?key=` query param
- `detect_upstream()` now identifies Google API from headers

### Changed
- `_stream()` helper accepts optional `params` dict for query string forwarding
- Version bumped to 0.5.0

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **OpenAI / Codex CLI support** — `POST /v1/chat/completions` endpoint proxies and compresses Codex requests
- **GPT-4o-mini compression for Codex** — reuses the OpenAI key already in the request, no extra keys needed
- **Smart upstream detection** — catch-all route detects Anthropic vs OpenAI from headers and forwards to the right API
- **OpenAI system message compression** — first `role: "system"` message compressed via GPT-4o-mini
- `openai>=1.0.0` added to requirements

### Changed
- `system_prompt.py` now accepts `use_openai=True` to compress via GPT-4o-mini
- `main.py` refactored: shared `_stream()` helper, dedicated OpenAI endpoint
- Version bumped to 0.4.0

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **System prompt compression** — Haiku compresses Claude Code's ~13KB system prompt on first request and caches it. Estimated -40% per request.
- **Adaptive thresholds** — compression aggressiveness scales with context pressure: low/mid/high/critical tiers based on % of context used
- **Compression cache** — repeated tool results are served from `~/.squeezr/cache.json` at zero Haiku cost. Hit rate shown in `/squeezr/stats`
- **Conversation compression** — opt-in (`compress_conversation = true` in `squeezr.toml`) to also compress old user/assistant messages
- **Auto-start on login** — `install.sh` configures launchd (macOS) or systemd (Linux); `install.ps1` registers a Windows Task Scheduler task
- **`squeezr.toml` config file** — all settings editable in TOML, env vars still override
- **Dry-run mode** — set `SQUEEZR_DRY_RUN=1` to see what would be compressed without modifying requests
- Cache stats (`size`, `hits`, `misses`, `hit_rate_pct`) exposed in `/squeezr/stats`
- Context pressure logged when above 50%

### Changed
- `config.py` reads from `squeezr.toml` first, env vars override
- `requirements.txt` adds `tomli` for Python < 3.11
- Version bumped to 0.3.0

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-31

- Per-tool savings tracking in stats (count, chars saved, avg compression %)
- Efficiency bar visualization (24-char block meter)
- Stats persistence to `~/.squeezr/stats.json` across proxy restarts
- `--reset` flag for `gain.py` to clear saved stats
- Tool name extraction from `tool_use` blocks to enrich compression reporting

### Changed
- `stats.py` now tracks `by_tool` breakdown per request
- `compressor.py` now returns tool names alongside savings data
- Version bumped to 0.2.0

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Local API proxy that intercepts Claude Code requests to Anthropic API
- Semantic compression of old tool results using Claude Haiku
- Configurable compression threshold (`SQUEEZR_THRESHOLD`, default 800 chars)
