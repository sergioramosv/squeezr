# Changelog

All notable changes to Squeezr will be documented here.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-04-03
### Fixed
- **`squeezr setup` on Windows** — auto-start now uses NSSM when available, registering Squeezr as a proper Windows service with automatic restart on crash. Falls back to Task Scheduler if NSSM is not installed or admin privileges are missing. Eliminates `ConnectionRefused` errors caused by the proxy crashing mid-session without recovery.
- **NSSM service config** — stdout/stderr logs to `~/.squeezr/service-stdout.log` / `service-stderr.log` with 24h rotation and 3s restart delay.

### Added
- `NSSM_WINDOWS_SERVICE.md` — full guide covering installation, service creation, log inspection, troubleshooting, and uninstall.
- README — NSSM documented as recommended Windows auto-start method with quick-install commands.

## [1.13.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **`squeezr stop` on WSL2** — `lsof -ti :PORT` returns multiple PIDs (listening process + connected clients); now uses `-sTCP:LISTEN` flag to get only the listening process, with fallback to `fuser`. Stops reliably on first try.
- **`squeezr setup` on Unix** — detects existing shell profiles missing `HTTPS_PROXY`/`SSL_CERT_FILE` (MITM proxy vars from older installs) and rewrites the block to include them.
- **`squeezr setup` on WSL2** — same fix as Unix: old profiles without MITM vars now get updated automatically.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Codex MITM compression** — Squeezr can now compress OpenAI Codex CLI context in real-time. A TLS-terminating MITM proxy on port 8081 intercepts Codex's WebSocket traffic to `chatgpt.com`, finds `function_call_output` tool results exceeding the threshold, and compresses them via a separate WebSocket call to `gpt-5.4-mini` using the same ChatGPT OAuth token — no API keys needed, no extra costs beyond your existing Codex subscription.
- **WebSocket frame parser/builder** — full implementation of RFC 6455 frame encoding/decoding with masking support, used for both intercepting Codex frames and making compression requests.
- **Automatic `permessage-deflate` stripping** — the MITM strips `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` from upgrade requests so frames arrive as plain text, avoiding deflate context desync when modifying payloads.
- **`chatgpt-account-id` capture** — intercepted from HTTP requests and forwarded to compression calls for proper account scoping.

### Changed
- **MITM proxy rewritten** — replaced the broken HTTP POST compression approach (Cloudflare 403) with direct WebSocket-to-WebSocket compression. The proxy now opens a dedicated WS connection to `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` for each compression call.
- Removed unused dependencies: `ws`, `fzstd`, `@types/ws`.
- Removed unused `oauthRefresh.ts`.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Codex MITM proxy (experimental)** — HTTPS proxy on port 8081 with auto-generated CA for TLS termination. Intercepts `CONNECT` tunnels, generates per-host certificates, and supports WebSocket upgrade detection. `squeezr setup` now configures `HTTPS_PROXY` and `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variables for Codex integration.
- **`node-forge` dependency** — for CA/certificate generation.

## [1.11.3] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **Codex WebSocket proxy** — Codex v0.118 uses WebSocket (`ws://`) for the Responses API. Squeezr now upgrades HTTP connections on `/responses` and `/v1/responses` to a bidirectional WebSocket proxy that forwards to `wss://api.openai.com`. Includes automatic ChatGPT OAuth token refresh on `401` mid-stream.
- **WebSocket routing for OAuth tokens** — ChatGPT OAuth bearer tokens (JWTs starting with `eyJ`) were incorrectly detected as local Ollama keys, routing WebSocket traffic to `ws://localhost:11434` instead of `wss://api.openai.com`. Fixed by excluding JWT-format tokens from the local-key check.
- **OAuth token proxy** — added `/oauth/token` pass-through so Codex can use `CODEX_REFRESH_TOKEN_URL_OVERRIDE=http://localhost:PORT/oauth/token` when needed.
- **`/models` path rewrite** — catch-all now rewrites bare `/models` (and other OpenAI root paths) to `/v1/models` so Codex model enumeration works correctly.

## [1.11.2] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **Codex / OpenAI Responses API support** — Codex CLI uses the Responses API (`POST /responses`) instead of Chat Completions. Squeezr now has dedicated routes for both `/responses` and `/v1/responses` with full streaming (SSE pipe-through), compression of `function_call_output` tool results, and correct header forwarding. Previously these requests fell through to the catch-all, which blocked indefinitely on streaming responses and caused 401 errors.
- **Catch-all streaming** — the catch-all handler now detects `text/event-stream` responses and pipes them through correctly instead of buffering the full response with `arrayBuffer()`.

## [1.11.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Daemon resilience** — `squeezr start` now survives Ctrl+C and terminal close. The daemon ignores `SIGINT` and `SIGHUP`; only `squeezr stop` (which sends `SIGTERM`) can stop it. Dev mode (`npm run dev`) still responds to Ctrl+C as before.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **WSL2 support** — `squeezr setup` now detects WSL2 automatically. Configures both the WSL shell profile (`.bashrc`/`.zshrc`) and Windows environment (`setx`). Auto-start cascades: systemd → Windows Task Scheduler → shell auto-heal.
- **Auto-heal guard** — on all Unix platforms (macOS, Linux, WSL2), `squeezr setup` adds a shell profile snippet that checks if the proxy is alive on every terminal open and starts it in the background if not. Zero manual intervention after setup, ever.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **`squeezr setup`** — one-command setup on any OS. Sets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `openai_base_url`, `GEMINI_API_BASE_URL` permanently and registers Squeezr as a login service (Task Scheduler on Windows, launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux). After running `squeezr setup` once and restarting the terminal, everything works automatically.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **OAuth / subscription support** — Claude Code via claude.ai subscription (no API key) now works fully. Squeezr extracts the `Authorization: Bearer` token and reuses it for Haiku compression calls, so no extra credentials are needed regardless of how you authenticate.
- **`skip_tools` / `only_tools` config** — explicit control over which tools Squeezr compresses. `skip_tools = ["Read"]` blacklists specific tools; `only_tools = ["Bash"]` whitelists (takes priority over skip_tools).
- **`# squeezr:skip` inline marker** — add anywhere in a Bash command to prevent that specific result from being compressed (e.g. `git diff HEAD~3  # squeezr:skip`). Supported in Anthropic and OpenAI formats.
- **10 new tests** — `shouldSkipTool` logic in config (7 cases), skip/only/inline-skip in compressor (3 cases) (190 total)

### Changed
- `Config.shouldSkipTool(name)` method: checks `onlyTools` whitelist first, then `skipTools` blacklist
- `squeezr.toml`: added commented-out examples for `skip_tools`, `only_tools`, and inline `# squeezr:skip`
- Published as `squeezr-ai` on npm (name `squeezr` was taken by an unrelated image tool)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Health endpoint returned `v1.0.0`** — `GET /squeezr/health` now returns the real version. Introduced `src/version.ts` as single source of truth; `index.ts` and `server.ts` both import from it. No more manual version drift across files.
- **`squeezr discover` showed `readDedup: 0`** — cross-turn Read dedup runs in `compressor.ts`, not `deterministic.ts`. Added exported `hitPattern()` to `deterministic.ts` and call it from the dedup step.

### Added
- **Cross-turn Read dedup for OpenAI/Gemini** — parity with Anthropic format. `compressOpenAIMessages` and `compressGeminiContents` now detect and collapse duplicate file reads.
- **Adaptive deterministic patterns at high context pressure** — patterns now receive the request's `pressure` value and tighten thresholds automatically:
  - `git diff` at >90%: 0 context lines per hunk (was always 1)
  - `git log` at >75%: cap 20 commits; at >90%: cap 10 (was always 30)
  - `grep` at >75%: 6 matches/file; at >90%: 4 (was always 8)
  - generic truncation at >90%: keep last 30 lines from 50-line threshold (was 80/50)
- `pressure` param threaded through `preprocessForTool` → `applyBashPatterns` (backward-compatible default = 0)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Per-project `.squeezr.toml`** — Squeezr now looks for `.squeezr.toml` in the working directory and deep-merges it over the global config. Enables per-repo overrides (thresholds, compression model, etc.)
- **Cross-turn Read deduplication** — when the model reads the same file multiple times in a session, earlier occurrences are replaced with `[same file content as a later read — squeezr_expand(id) to retrieve]`. Keeps the most recent copy at full fidelity; collapses all earlier identical reads.
- **`squeezr discover`** — pattern coverage CLI that queries the running proxy and prints which deterministic patterns fired, how many outputs hit the generic fallback, and Read/Grep/Glob breakdown. Run after a session to spot coverage gaps.
- **Pattern hit tracking** — `detPatternHits` counter in `deterministic.ts` tracks every pattern match; exposed via `/squeezr/stats` as `pattern_hits`
- **README badges** — npm version, license, Node.js version, test count
- `src/discover.ts` new CLI command

### Changed
- `bin/squeezr.js`: added `discover` subcommand, bumped version string to 1.8.0

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Stack trace deduplication** — repeated Node.js/Python stack frames collapsed to `[same N-frame stack trace repeated]`; runs in base pipeline before per-tool patterns
- **Git diff function summary** — large diffs (>100 output lines) get a `Changed: fn1, fn2, ...` prefix extracted from `@@` headers
- **Semantic Read for large code files** — `.ts/.js/.py/.go/.rs` files >500 lines show imports + top-level signatures only, bodies omitted; smaller files keep head+tail
- 6 new tests (180 total)

### Changed
- `deduplicateStackTraces` runs before `deduplicateLines` in base pipeline (block-level dedup must precede line-level dedup)

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Playwright test compaction** — strips passing `✓` lines, keeps `✘`/FAILED blocks with context
- **Python/pytest compaction** — keeps `FAILED`/`ERROR` lines + tracebacks, strips passing dots
- **Go test compaction** — keeps `--- FAIL` blocks + `FAIL` summary, strips `--- PASS`
- **Terraform compaction** — keeps resource change blocks + Plan summary, strips attribute noise
- **`git branch` compaction** — caps at 20 branches with omission note
- **wget compaction** — strips progress/connection noise, keeps final URL + save path
- **Generic error extractor** — auto-extracts error lines ± context from any unrecognised output > 30 lines with > 50% noise (replaces manual `rtk err <cmd>` prefix)
- 15 new tests (174 total)

### Fixed
- `looksLikeGitBranch` false positive on Playwright output (now requires pure `[* ] identifier` branch name pattern, no colons/parens/brackets)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **`git status` compaction** — detects and compacts to `* branch [tracking] + Staged/Modified/Untracked` format (RTK parity)
- **`git log --oneline` detection** — caps at 30 commits with `... [N more commits]` (full verbose format was already supported)
- **`pnpm list` / `npm list` compaction** — keeps direct deps, strips nested tree with omission count
- **`pnpm outdated` compaction** — caps at 30 packages
- **Prisma CLI compaction** — strips ASCII box-drawing tip blocks, keeps meaningful output
- **`gh pr checks` compaction** — caps large check tables at 25 rows
- **Generic long-output truncation** — any unrecognised bash output > 80 lines gets last 50 lines + omission note (replaces the overly-broad docker logs detector)
- 20 new tests covering all new patterns (159 total)

### Fixed
- `looksLikePkgList` false-positive on Prisma box-drawing output (now requires `├──` not just `└──`)
- `looksLikeKubectl` false-positive on `gh pr checks` header (now requires specific kubectl column patterns)
- `compactGitStatus` on clean working tree now shows "nothing to commit" message

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Full unit test suite** — 139 tests across 6 test files covering all modules: `deterministic.ts`, `cache.ts`, `sessionCache.ts`, `expand.ts`, `config.ts`, `compressor.ts`

### Fixed
- `extractInstallSummary` regex `/\d+ packages? in/` → `/\d+ packages? in \d/` to prevent false matches on `packages installed`

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Full RTK pattern parity** — Squeezr now covers all major RTK tool patterns at the proxy level. No manual `rtk` prefix needed for any of these:
  - **git**: `diff` (context reduction to 1 line/hunk), `log` (one line per commit)
  - **cargo**: `test` (failures only), `build/check/clippy` (errors/warnings only, no "Compiling X" spam)
  - **JS/TS**: `vitest/jest` (failures only + summary), `tsc` (errors grouped by file), `eslint/biome` (grouped, no rule URLs), `prettier --check` (files needing format only), `next build` (route table + errors only)
  - **package managers**: `pnpm/npm install` (summary line only)
  - **Docker**: `ps` (compact), `images` (no dangling, short IDs), `logs` (last 50 lines)
  - **kubectl**: `get` (compact column alignment)
  - **gh CLI**: `pr view` (metadata only), `run list` (capped), `issue list` (capped)
  - **curl**: strip verbose `-v` headers, keep response body
- **Grep tool compaction** — matches grouped by file, capped at 8 per file, max 30 files
- **Read tool compaction** — files >200 lines show head + tail with omission note; lockfiles replaced with summary count

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **RTK-style turn-1 compression** — `preprocessForTool()` applies tool-specific deterministic patterns to ALL tool results including recent ones. No need to prefix commands with `rtk`. Covers: `git diff` (context line reduction), `cargo test/build/clippy` (errors/failures only), `vitest/jest` (failures only), `tsc` (errors grouped by file), `eslint/biome` (grouped, no rule URLs), `pnpm/npm install` (summary only), `Glob` (compact file listings).
- **Deterministic compression is now always on, even for recent blocks** — previously only AI compression was skipped for recent blocks. Now all blocks get at minimum the RTK-style pass.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Differential compression** — session-level cache tracks compressed blocks across requests. Blocks identical to a previous request skip the entire pipeline (preprocessing + AI call). In a 100-request session with 40 tool results: ~4,000 Haiku calls → ~200.
- **KV cache warming** — `storeOriginal` now uses a deterministic MD5-based ID instead of random bytes. Identical content always produces the same `[squeezr:id -ratio%]` string, preserving Anthropic's prefix cache across requests (90% cost reduction on unchanged history).
- `sessionCache.ts` — in-memory Map persisting for the lifetime of the proxy session
- `session_cache_hits` counter in stats summary and `/squeezr/stats` endpoint
- `session_cache_size` exposed in `/squeezr/stats`

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-31

### Changed
- **Full TypeScript rewrite** — entire codebase migrated from Python to TypeScript/Node.js
- **Hono** replaces FastAPI as the HTTP framework — faster startup, no Python runtime needed
- No more `pip install` — pure npm package, install with `npm install -g squeezr`
- Requires Node.js 18+ (was Python 3.9+)

### Added
- **Deterministic preprocessing pipeline** (6 stages before AI compression): strip ANSI codes, strip progress bars, strip timestamps, deduplicate repeated lines, minify inline JSON, collapse whitespace
- **`expand()` feature** — model can call `squeezr_expand(id)` to retrieve original content when needed; Squeezr intercepts the tool call and makes a continuation request transparently
- **Gemini CLI support** (`POST /v1beta/models/*`) — compresses `functionResponse` blocks using Gemini Flash 8B
- **Per-format compression**: Anthropic `tool_result`, OpenAI `role:tool`, Gemini `functionResponse`
- **`GET /squeezr/expand/:id`** endpoint to retrieve stored originals via HTTP
- LRU compression cache with configurable max entries
- System prompt compression with separate cache (`~/.squeezr/sysprompt_cache.json`)
- `src/gain.ts` — TypeScript gain stats CLI replacing `gain.py`

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Ollama / local LLM support** — requests with dummy keys (`ollama`, `lm-studio`, etc.) are detected as local and routed to Ollama
- **Configurable compression model** — set any model you have installed via `squeezr.toml [local] compression_model` or `SQUEEZR_LOCAL_MODEL` env var
- **`[local]` config section** in `squeezr.toml` with `upstream_url`, `compression_model`, and `dummy_keys`
- `config.is_local_key()` detects local requests from auth key
- `compress_local_messages()` uses Ollama's OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint for compression
- `SQUEEZR_LOCAL_UPSTREAM` and `SQUEEZR_LOCAL_MODEL` env var overrides

### Changed
- `/v1/chat/completions` now checks for local key before routing to OpenAI
- Version bumped to 0.6.0

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Gemini CLI support** — `/v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent` endpoint intercepts and compresses Gemini requests
- **Gemini Flash 8B compression** — cheapest Google model compresses `functionResponse` parts, reuses `x-goog-api-key` from request
- **Gemini system instruction compression** — `systemInstruction` field compressed via Flash 8B and cached
- **Gemini streaming** — `streamGenerateContent` SSE forwarded transparently
- `system_prompt.py` now supports `use_google=True` for Gemini system prompts
- `extract_google_key()` reads `x-goog-api-key` header or `?key=` query param
- `detect_upstream()` now identifies Google API from headers

### Changed
- `_stream()` helper accepts optional `params` dict for query string forwarding
- Version bumped to 0.5.0

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **OpenAI / Codex CLI support** — `POST /v1/chat/completions` endpoint proxies and compresses Codex requests
- **GPT-4o-mini compression for Codex** — reuses the OpenAI key already in the request, no extra keys needed
- **Smart upstream detection** — catch-all route detects Anthropic vs OpenAI from headers and forwards to the right API
- **OpenAI system message compression** — first `role: "system"` message compressed via GPT-4o-mini
- `openai>=1.0.0` added to requirements

### Changed
- `system_prompt.py` now accepts `use_openai=True` to compress via GPT-4o-mini
- `main.py` refactored: shared `_stream()` helper, dedicated OpenAI endpoint
- Version bumped to 0.4.0

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **System prompt compression** — Haiku compresses Claude Code's ~13KB system prompt on first request and caches it. Estimated -40% per request.
- **Adaptive thresholds** — compression aggressiveness scales with context pressure: low/mid/high/critical tiers based on % of context used
- **Compression cache** — repeated tool results are served from `~/.squeezr/cache.json` at zero Haiku cost. Hit rate shown in `/squeezr/stats`
- **Conversation compression** — opt-in (`compress_conversation = true` in `squeezr.toml`) to also compress old user/assistant messages
- **Auto-start on login** — `install.sh` configures launchd (macOS) or systemd (Linux); `install.ps1` registers a Windows Task Scheduler task
- **`squeezr.toml` config file** — all settings editable in TOML, env vars still override
- **Dry-run mode** — set `SQUEEZR_DRY_RUN=1` to see what would be compressed without modifying requests
- Cache stats (`size`, `hits`, `misses`, `hit_rate_pct`) exposed in `/squeezr/stats`
- Context pressure logged when above 50%

### Changed
- `config.py` reads from `squeezr.toml` first, env vars override
- `requirements.txt` adds `tomli` for Python < 3.11
- Version bumped to 0.3.0

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-31

- Per-tool savings tracking in stats (count, chars saved, avg compression %)
- Efficiency bar visualization (24-char block meter)
- Stats persistence to `~/.squeezr/stats.json` across proxy restarts
- `--reset` flag for `gain.py` to clear saved stats
- Tool name extraction from `tool_use` blocks to enrich compression reporting

### Changed

- `compressor.py` now returns tool names alongside savings data
- Version bumped to 0.2.0

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Local API proxy that intercepts Claude Code requests to Anthropic API
